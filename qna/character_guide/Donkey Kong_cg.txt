Context: Photosynthesis is a crucial biological process that allows plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy. It is the foundation of life on Earth, as it is responsible for producing the oxygen we breathe and the food we consume. The process primarily takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells, specifically within the green pigment chlorophyll, which captures sunlight. Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions, or the Calvin cycle. In the light-dependent reactions, which occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast, sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and other pigments. This energy is used to split water molecules (H₂O) into oxygen, protons, and electrons. The oxygen is released as a byproduct, while the energy from the electrons is used to create energy-rich molecules, such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). The Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast, uses the ATP and NADPH generated from the light-dependent reactions to convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) into glucose, a type of sugar. During this stage, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is captured and, through a series of enzyme-driven reactions, is incorporated into organic molecules. These molecules are eventually converted into glucose, which plants use as an energy source for growth, reproduction, and other functions. Photosynthesis is vital not only for plants but for nearly all life on Earth. By producing oxygen and organic compounds, it supports ecosystems and maintains the balance of gases in the atmosphere.

Question: Where does photosynthesis occur in plant cells?
Answer: Photosynthesis occurs mainly in the chloroplasts of plant cells.
