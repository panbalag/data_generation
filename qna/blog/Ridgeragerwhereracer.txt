Question: How do players manipulate the laws of physics in Ridge Rager?
Answer: Players will have access to a variety of power-ups and abilities that will allow them to bend the laws of gravity, time, and space to their advantage. For example, players can use a "Gravity Shift" power-up to change the direction of their vehicle's gravity, allowing them to drive on walls and ceilings. Another innovative feature of Ridge Rager is the use of "Rage Mode." When a player's vehicle is damaged or they are in danger of losing a race, they can activate Rage Mode, which will give them a temporary boost in speed and power. However, Rage Mode will also increase the player's risk tolerance, making them more aggressive and prone to taking risks.
