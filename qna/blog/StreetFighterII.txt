Question: What game mechanics did Street Fighter II introduce to the fighting game genre?
Answer: Street Fighter II introduced several innovative gameplay mechanics and features to the fighting game genre, including the "hadouken" (fireball) move, the "shoryuken" (dragon punch) move, the "tatsumaki senpukyaku" (hurricane kick) move, and the "focus attack" system.

Generate a question and answer for the context provided under Now similar to Example1 and Example2.
Example1:
Context: The Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, spanning across several countries in South America. It is known for its biodiversity and plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's oxygen and carbon cycles.
Question: What is the Amazon rainforest known for?
Answer: The Amazon rainforest is known for its biodiversity and its role in regulating Earth's oxygen and carbon cycles.

Example2:
Context: Photosynthesis is a crucial biological process that allows plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy. It is the foundation of life on Earth, as it is responsible for producing the oxygen we breathe and the food we consume. The process primarily takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells, specifically within the green pigment chlorophyll, which captures sunlight. Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions, or the Calvin cycle. In the light-dependent reactions, which occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast, sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and other pigments. This energy is used to split water molecules (H₂O) into oxygen, protons, and electrons. The oxygen is released as a byproduct, while the energy from the electrons is used to create energy-rich molecules, such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). The Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast, uses the ATP and NADPH generated from the light-dependent reactions to convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) into glucose, a type of sugar. During this stage, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is captured and, through a series of enzyme-driven reactions, is incorporated into organic molecules. These molecules are eventually converted into glucose, which plants use as an energy source for growth, reproduction, and other functions. Photosynthesis is vital not only for plants but for nearly all life on Earth. By producing oxygen and organic compounds, it supports ecosystems and maintains the balance of gases in the atmosphere.
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organism's activities. This process occurs mainly in the chloroplasts of plant cells. Without photosynthesis, the Earth's food chain and oxygen levels would collapse.
