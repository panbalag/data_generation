Question: How do I defeat the game's main antagonist?
Answer: To defeat the game's main antagonist, use all of your magic and farming skills to fend off the supernatural threats that lurk in the haunted land. Keep an eye on your farm's resources and restock as needed. Use the "Cast Spell" option to summon a protective barrier around your crops, and the "Harvest" option to collect any crops that are ready to be picked. If you are successful in defeating the main antagonist, you will be rewarded with a bounty of crops and other items. If you fail, your farm will be destroyed and you will have to start over.
