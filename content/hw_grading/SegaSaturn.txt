Cleaning and Maintenance
------------------------

To keep your Sega Saturn system in top condition, it's important to clean and maintain it regularly. Here are some tips for cleaning and maintaining your system:

* Clean the exterior of the system regularly with a soft cloth and mild soap and water solution. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that can damage the plastic or metal components.

* Use a can of compressed air to blow out any dust and debris from the vents and other openings.
* Avoid touching the circuit boards and other sensitive components with your bare hands, as the oils from your skin can damage the components. If you need to handle the components, use a soft, anti-static cloth to protect the components from static electricity.
