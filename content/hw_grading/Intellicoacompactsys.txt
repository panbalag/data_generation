	* Grade 3: CPU is in good condition with minimal signs of wear.
	* Grade 4: CPU is in excellent condition, showing no signs of wear.
2. RAM (16MB):
	* Grade 1: RAM is damaged or broken.
	* Grade 2: RAM is scratched or has minor cosmetic damage.
	* Grade 3: RAM is in good condition with minimal signs of wear.
	* Grade 4: RAM is in excellent condition, showing no signs of wear.
3. 3D Mode using Cartridges:
	* Grade 1: The 3D mode is not functioning properly or is damaged.
	* Grade 2: The 3D mode is scratched or has minor cosmetic damage.
	* Grade 3: The 3D mode is in good condition with minimal signs of wear.
	* Grade 4: The 3D mode is in excellent condition, showing no signs of wear.
4. Power Supply:
	* Grade 1: The power supply is damaged or broken.
	* Grade 2: The power supply is scratched or has minor cosmetic damage.
	* Grade 3: The power supply is in good condition with minimal signs of wear.
	* Grade 4: The power supply is in excellent condition, showing no signs of wear.
5. Cartridges:
	* Grade 1: The cartridges are damaged or broken.
	* Grade 2: The cartridges are scratched or have minor cosmetic damage.
	* Grade 3: The cartridges are in good condition with minimal signs of wear.
	* Grade 4: The cartridges are in excellent condition, showing no signs of wear.

Grading Criteria

When grading your Intellico system, we will consider the following criteria:

1. Cosmetic condition: The system's appearance, including scratches, dents, and discoloration.

3. Age and rarity: The system's age and rarity, which can affect its value.

Grading Examples

Here are some examples of how we would grade different Intellico systems based on the criteria above:

Example 1:

* CPU (32-bit): Grade 3 (in good condition with minimal signs of wear).
* RAM (16MB): Grade 3 (in good condition with minimal signs of wear).
* 3D Mode using Cartridges: Grade 3 (in good condition with minimal signs of wear).
* Power Supply: Grade 3 (in good condition with minimal signs of wear).
* Cartridges: Grade 3 (in good condition with minimal signs of wear).

Example 2:

* CPU (32-bit): Grade 4 (in excellent condition, showing no signs of wear).
* RAM (16MB): Grade 4 (in excellent condition, showing no signs of wear).
* 3D Mode using Cartridges: Grade 4 (in excellent condition, showing no signs of wear).
* Power Supply: Grade 4 (in excellent condition, showing no signs of wear).
* Cartridges: Grade 4 (in excellent condition, showing no signs of wear).
