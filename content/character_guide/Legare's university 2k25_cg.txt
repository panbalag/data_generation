Write a detailed game walkthrough guide for the game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U consoles. The game follows the story of Link, the protagonist, as he explores the vast open world of Hyrule and battles against the forces of darkness to save the kingdom.

Here is a detailed walkthrough guide for the game:

The game begins with Link waking up in a mysterious place, with no memory of who he is or how he got there.

The player must guide Link as he explores the area, collecting weapons and resources, and battling against enemies.

The goal of the chapter is to reach the Great Plateau, where Link will meet the old man who will give him his first mission.

Chapter 2: The Great Plateau

In this chapter, Link must complete a series of challenges and puzzles to prove himself to the old man.

The challenges include climbing a tall tower, solving a puzzle to open a locked door, and battling against a powerful enemy.

Once Link completes the challenges, the old man will give him the Spirit Orb, which will allow him to travel to other areas of the game world.

Chapter 3: Hyrule Castle

In this chapter, Link must travel to Hyrule Castle, which is located in the center of the game world.

Along the way, Link will encounter various enemies and obstacles, including guardians, Lynels, and environmental hazards.

Once Link reaches the castle, he must battle against the castle's defenders and the castle's boss, the Guard Captain.

Chapter 4: The Lost Woods

In this chapter, Link must travel to the Lost Woods, which is located to the west of Hyrule Castle.

The Lost Woods is a dense forest filled with dangerous creatures and traps.
